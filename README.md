Recovering the Lombard Reimagined Site
--------------------------------------

It got hacked. Now we're fixing it.

See the work in progress @ http://stage.lombardreimagined.com.

Please, let me know about broken and missing things. I'll keep my 
eyes out for them. To let me know about issues, use github's
[issues list](https://github.com/changecase/lombard-reimagined/issues).

Because of the way that WordPress stores some pretty important log in
information (like database access), I've made this a private repo. That
means that you'll need a github account and I'll need to grant you 
access to the repo. Let me know you want to help by sending an [email](mailto:jeff.ja@gmail.com)
with your github account info.
